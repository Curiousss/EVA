### Phase2/Session 7: Self Driving car using Kivy and Neural network with Full connected layers
- Enhance the model in the existing code
- Update the parameters
- Test with different maps.

### Phase2/Session 5: MNIST Dataset classification in Pytorch with following features:
- less than 15k params
- uses dropout of 0.1 
- uses batchnorm
- uses randomrotate transform
- uses StepLR with step size = 6 and gamma = 0.1
- achieves 99.3% test accuracy
- less than 15 epochs. 

### Phase2/Session 3: Implementation of the internal LSTM layer from scratch.

### Phase2/Session 2: Exploring RNN and embedding layers.

### Phase2/Session 1:Precomputed Glove embeddings
Precomputed embeddings downloaded from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove. Train the GLOVE based model with 8000 samples
