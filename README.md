# Extensive AI projects

## Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning
#### Session 9: T3D OR TWIN DELAYED DDPG
Explaination with diagrams for existing code

#### Session 8: 
- Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C): Flow chart of functions for existing code
- Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent on the CartPole-v0 task from the OpenAI Gym:  Flow chart of functions for existing code

##### Session 7: Self Driving car using Kivy and Neural network with Full connected layers
- Enhance the model in the existing code
- Update the parameters
- Test with different maps.

## Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision
1. Assignment 1 : Types of Kernels and convolutional arithmetic
2. Assignment 2 : Receptive field
3. Assignment 3 : MNIST 99.4% with < 20000 Parameters, Vanilla network (no BN, DropOut, LR, larger batch size, change in Optimizer, etc)
4. Assignment 4 : 99.4% accuracy Less than 15k Parameters(with BN, DropOut, LR, larger batch size, change in Optimizer, etc)

\25. Car Image Generation with GANs
